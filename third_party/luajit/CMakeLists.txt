# CMakeLists.txt for LuaJIT (placeholder)
# In a real scenario, this would build LuaJIT from its sources.
# LuaJIT's build system is typically makefile-based, so often one might use
# ExternalProject_Add or a custom build script here.
# For this conceptual integration, we'll define a placeholder static library.

# Define the LuaJIT library target
# In a real build, you would list all the .c and .h files from LuaJIT's src directory.
# For example:
# file(GLOB LUAJIT_SOURCES
#    "src/lj_*.c"
#    "src/lib_*.c"
#    # ... any other necessary LuaJIT source files
# )
# file(GLOB LUAJIT_HEADERS "src/lua.hpp" "src/luajit.h" "src/lua.h" "src/lauxlib.h" "src/lualib.h")


# For this placeholder, we create an INTERFACE library because we don't have sources.
# In a real build, it would be add_library(luajit STATIC ${LUAJIT_SOURCES})
add_library(luajit INTERFACE)

# If it were a real static library, you would do:
# add_library(luajit STATIC
#   # Mock source file, otherwise CMake complains
#   # In reality, list all LuaJIT .c files here
#   # e.g., src/lj_api.c src/lj_lex.c ...
#   # For the purpose of this PoC, we can't provide them.
#   # A common approach is to have a dummy .c file if sources are not present
#   # or use ExternalProject_Add.
# )
# target_compile_options(luajit PRIVATE -Wall ...) # Add appropriate compile flags

# This is crucial: it makes sure that targets linking against 'luajit'
# automatically get its include directory.
target_include_directories(luajit INTERFACE

# Define any necessary compile definitions for LuaJIT, e.g., platform specifics
# target_compile_definitions(luajit PUBLIC
#    LUAJIT_ENABLE_LUA52COMPAT # Example define
# )

# If LuaJIT needs to link against other libraries (e.g., -lm on Linux), specify them:
# target_link_libraries(luajit PUBLIC m) # Example for math library

# This placeholder assumes that the LuaJIT headers (lua.hpp, luajit.h, etc.)
# would be located in third_party/luajit/src/.
# If using ExternalProject_Add, the include directory would point to the

# add_library(luajit STATIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/dummy_luajit_source.c)
# For now, INTERFACE is simpler for a placeholder.
# This means linking will succeed, but actual LuaJIT functionality depends on headers being present
# and the actual library being provided at link/runtime if not statically incorporated.
# For DuckDB's build, we'd want static linking.
#
# A more robust placeholder for a static library without source files
# (if one absolutely had to avoid ExternalProject for a conceptual step):
# add_library(luajit STATIC IMPORTED)
# set_target_properties(luajit PROPERTIES
#   IMPORTED_LOCATION "/path/to/precompiled/libluajit.a" # This would be problematic
#   INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src"
# )
# Using INTERFACE is the cleanest placeholder when no actual compilation of LuaJIT is done by this CMake file.
# It effectively says "this target exists, and here's its include path".
# The actual linking will only work if DuckDB's main CMakeLists.txt provides a real luajit library
# (e.g. if it was pre-compiled or fetched via another mechanism and linked).
# The add_subdirectory approach assumes this CMakeLists.txt *creates* the luajit target.
#
# To make `target_link_libraries(duckdb PRIVATE luajit)` work from the parent scope
# without actual LuaJIT sources, an INTERFACE library is the most straightforward placeholder.
# It makes `luajit` a known target and specifies its include directories.
# The parent `target_link_libraries` will then correctly add include paths.
# The actual linking of symbols would fail later if `luajit` isn't truly built/provided,
# but for header inclusion and CMake configuration, it's fine.
#
# For the purpose of this task, where we are creating wrapper code that needs to compile,
# having the INTERFACE library propagate include directories is the key.
# The DuckDB compilation will find "lua.hpp" if it's in third_party/luajit/src.
#
# Let's assume this is what we want for a conceptual step:
# 1. This file defines `luajit` as an INTERFACE library.
# 2. It tells CMake that anything linking to `luajit` needs `third_party/luajit/src` in its include path.
# 3. DuckDB's main CMake links to `luajit`.
# 4. DuckDB's source files can now `#include <lua.hpp>`.
#
# The actual LuaJIT symbols would need to come from a real build or precompiled library
# when DuckDB itself is finally linked. This CMake structure allows the C++ wrapper code
# to compile successfully.
#
# Consider LuaJIT typically needs to be built with specific options (e.g., -fPIC if it's part of a shared object).
# These would be set via target_compile_options if building statically.
#
# For a header-only experience for the wrapper (compilation only, no linking test):
# add_library(luajit INTERFACE)
# target_include_directories(luajit INTERFACE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src")
# This is the simplest placeholder for the current task.
# Note: LuaJIT is NOT header-only. It requires compiled C code.
# This placeholder is purely for letting DuckDB's C++ code find LuaJIT's headers.
# The linking step for DuckDB would fail unless a compiled LuaJIT library is actually provided.
# However, for developing the wrapper, this is often sufficient to get the C++ code to compile.
#
# To make this slightly more realistic for a static build scenario:
# Remove the INTERFACE library above and uncomment this:
# file(WRITE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/luajit_dummy.c "void luajit_dummy_func() {}")
# add_library(luajit STATIC ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/luajit_dummy.c)
# target_include_directories(luajit PUBLIC
#    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src" # PUBLIC so consumers get it
# )
# This creates a real (but empty) static library, which is closer to the desired structure.
# Let's use this approach for better conceptual accuracy.

file(WRITE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/luajit_dummy.c
"// Dummy C file for placeholder LuaJIT static library\nvoid luajit_dummy_func() {}\n")
