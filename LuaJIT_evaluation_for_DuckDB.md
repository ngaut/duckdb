# LuaJIT JIT Framework Evaluation for DuckDB

## Introduction

This document evaluates LuaJIT as a potential Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation framework for DuckDB. LuaJIT is a high-performance JIT compiler for the Lua programming language. We will explore its suitability for DuckDB, focusing on C++ interoperability, data marshalling, and best practices for embedding LuaJIT within a C++ application like DuckDB. This evaluation is based on general knowledge of LuaJIT and embedding scripting languages.

## LuaJIT Overview

LuaJIT is known for its impressive performance, often rivaling or exceeding that of statically compiled C code in certain benchmarks, especially for tasks involving loops and numerical computations. It achieves this through a sophisticated trace compiler.

**Key Features of LuaJIT:**

*   **High Performance:** Its tracing JIT compiler is highly optimized.
*   **FFI (Foreign Function Interface):** Provides a powerful and efficient way to call C functions and use C data structures directly from Lua code without wrapper code.
*   **Small Footprint:** LuaJIT itself is relatively lightweight.
*   **Embeddable:** Designed to be easily embedded in larger applications.
*   **Mature:** Well-established and used in many high-performance applications (e.g., games, financial trading).

## Evaluation Criteria for DuckDB

### 1. C++ Interoperability

*   **Lua C API:** Lua (and LuaJIT by extension) provides a well-defined C API for embedding the Lua interpreter, loading scripts, calling Lua functions from C/C++, and exposing C/C++ functions to Lua. This is the standard way to interact.
*   **LuaJIT FFI:** This is a standout feature. The FFI allows LuaJIT code to directly call C functions (e.g., functions within DuckDB's execution engine or utility functions) and access C data structures without writing explicit C bindings.
    *   **Usage:** You declare C function signatures and data structures in Lua. LuaJIT then handles the marshalling and calling conventions.
    *   **Performance:** The FFI is designed to be very low overhead, often approaching the speed of a direct C call. This is crucial for performance-sensitive database operations.
*   **C++ Name Mangling:** When exposing C++ functions, `extern "C"` is typically used to avoid C++ name mangling issues, making them callable via the Lua C API or FFI. For C++ classes and methods, wrapper functions or a binding generator might be needed if not using FFI with C-compatible interfaces.
*   **Object Lifecycles:** Managing the lifecycle of objects that are shared or passed between C++ and Lua requires careful attention to avoid dangling pointers or premature garbage collection. Reference counting or other ownership C++ mechanisms might need to be bridged with Lua's garbage collector.

### 2. Data Marshalling (Lua <-> C++/DuckDB)

This is a critical aspect for using LuaJIT to JIT-compile parts of DuckDB queries. DuckDB operates on vectorized data, typically in C++ structures.

*   **Primitive Types:** Marshalling primitive types (integers, floats, booleans, strings) is generally straightforward using the Lua C API or LuaJIT FFI. The FFI can often handle these directly when calling C functions.
*   **Complex Data Structures (e.g., DuckDB Vectors):**
    *   **Via FFI:** If DuckDB's vector structures are C-compatible structs (or can be exposed as such), LuaJIT's FFI could potentially access their data buffers (e.g., `data_ptr`, `count`, `nullmask`) directly. This would be the most performant option, avoiding copies.
        ```lua
        -- Example FFI declaration (conceptual)
        local ffi = require("ffi")
        ffi.cdef[[
            typedef struct {
                void* data;
                uint64_t count;
                // ... other vector components like nullmask
            } duckdb_vector;

            // Declare C functions from DuckDB to be called
            // double process_vector(duckdb_vector* vec, int some_param);
        ]]
        ```
    *   **Via Lua C API:** Data would need to be copied element by element or in chunks between Lua tables (or LuaJIT's `cdata` objects) and DuckDB's C++ vector structures. This would likely be too slow for large vectors.
*   **Data Copying vs. Direct Access:** The primary goal would be to avoid data copying as much as possible. LuaJIT's FFI offers the best path here by allowing Lua code to operate on pointers to C/C++ data structures.
*   **Data Layout:** LuaJIT compiled code would need to understand DuckDB's columnar data layout to process it efficiently. The FFI helps in defining these layouts for the Lua code.

### 3. Suitability for DuckDB's JIT Compilation Goals

*   **Expression Compilation:** LuaJIT could be used to JIT-compile scalar expressions within DuckDB's vectorized execution model. A Lua script representing the expression logic would be generated, compiled by LuaJIT, and then invoked repeatedly over the data in DuckDB's vectors (accessed via FFI).
*   **Overhead:**
    *   **Compilation Overhead:** LuaJIT's compiler is very fast, especially for smaller scripts. This is a significant advantage over LLVM.
    *   **Runtime Overhead:** Calling Lua functions (even JIT-compiled ones via FFI) from C++ will have some overhead, but the FFI is designed to minimize this. The performance of the JIT-compiled Lua code itself is excellent.
*   **Language Mismatch:** Using Lua means query logic or expressions would need to be translated into Lua. This adds a layer of indirection compared to directly generating machine code (like asmjit) or a lower-level IR (like LLVM).
*   **Sandboxing and Security:** Lua provides a sandboxed environment. While powerful, this might also restrict some low-level operations if not carefully managed via FFI. For internal database use, this is less of a concern than for user-defined functions.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging JIT-compiled Lua code can be done with LuaJIT's tools, but it's different from debugging C++ code.

### 4. Best Practices for Embedding LuaJIT in C++

*   **Lua State Management:** Maintain one or more Lua states (`lua_State`). For concurrent query execution in DuckDB, this would likely mean one Lua state per thread, or careful synchronization if states are shared.
*   **Error Handling:** Use `lua_pcall` for protected calls into Lua to catch errors. Errors in Lua should be propagated back to C++ in a structured way.
*   **Memory Management:**
    *   LuaJIT has its own garbage collector. Understand how it interacts with C++ memory management, especially for data shared via FFI.
    *   Ensure C data structures outlive their use by Lua. The LuaJIT FFI `ffi.gc` can be used to attach Lua GC finalizers to C pointers, which can then call C++ destructors or decrement reference counts.
*   **API Design for FFI:** Expose C-style functions or structs from DuckDB for the FFI. Avoid complex C++ features like templates or heavy class hierarchies directly in FFI definitions.
*   **Code Generation to Lua:** DuckDB would generate Lua code strings dynamically based on the query plan's expressions. These strings would then be loaded and compiled by LuaJIT.
    *   Example: A SQL expression `a + b * 2` might be translated into a Lua function string like:
      `"local ffi = require('ffi') return function(a_ptr, b_ptr, out_ptr, count) for i=0,count-1 do out_ptr[i] = a_ptr[i] + b_ptr[i] * 2 end end"`
      (This is a simplified conceptual example; actual vector access would be more complex via FFI struct pointers).
*   **Pre-compilation/Caching:** LuaJIT can compile Lua code to bytecode. This bytecode can be cached to reduce compilation time for frequently used expressions, although the JIT compilation from bytecode to machine code still happens at runtime.

## Comparison with Other Frameworks (asmjit, LLVM)

*   **vs. asmjit:**
    *   **Pros for LuaJIT:** Higher-level language, potentially faster development of JIT logic (writing Lua vs. assembly/low-level IR), excellent FFI.
    *   **Cons for LuaJIT:** Introduces another language/runtime; performance might not be as "bare-metal" as finely tuned asmjit code for very specific, simple expressions where LuaJIT's overhead or abstractions might be greater. Data marshalling can be more complex if not using FFI on raw pointers.
*   **vs. LLVM:**
    *   **Pros for LuaJIT:** Much faster compilation times, simpler API, smaller footprint, powerful FFI.
    *   **Cons for LuaJIT:** LLVM has more sophisticated optimization passes for complex code. LLVM generates native machine code directly without an intermediate VM/language runtime.

## Conclusion and Preliminary Recommendation for DuckDB

LuaJIT presents an interesting option for JIT compilation in DuckDB, primarily due to its high-performance JIT compiler and exceptional FFI capabilities.

**Potential Advantages for DuckDB:**

*   **Fast Compilation:** Addresses a key weakness of LLVM.
*   **Powerful FFI:** Could allow efficient, direct access to DuckDB's C++ vector data from JIT-compiled Lua code, minimizing data copying.
*   **High-Level Abstraction:** Generating Lua code might be simpler than generating LLVM IR or raw assembly for complex expressions.

**Potential Challenges for DuckDB:**

*   **Language Indirection:** Translating query expressions to Lua introduces an extra step and a different programming paradigm.
*   **Data Marshalling Complexity:** While FFI is powerful, ensuring seamless and zero-copy access to DuckDB's potentially complex C++ vector structures requires careful design.
*   **Runtime Overhead:** Even with FFI, there will be some overhead when transitioning between C++ and Lua contexts. This needs to be benchmarked against the performance gains from JIT compilation.
*   **Team Expertise:** Requires the development team to be comfortable with Lua.

**Preliminary Recommendation:**

LuaJIT is a viable candidate and worth considering, especially if the FFI can be leveraged effectively for near zero-copy access to DuckDB's vectorized data. Its main advantage over asmjit would be the higher-level language for expressing the JIT-compiled logic, potentially speeding up development for more complex expressions. However, it also introduces an additional language runtime and its associated complexities.

A focused proof-of-concept, specifically testing the FFI's performance and ease of use with DuckDB's vector structures and calling conventions, would be essential to make a final decision. This PoC should directly compare the performance (compilation time + execution time) of a few representative expressions compiled via LuaJIT versus DuckDB's current expression interpreter and potentially a prototype using asmjit.
