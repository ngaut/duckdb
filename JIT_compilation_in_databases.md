# JIT Compilation in Database Systems

This document summarizes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation approaches in database systems, focusing on HyPer, ClickHouse, and Peloton.

## Introduction

JIT compilation is a technique where code is compiled during program execution (at runtime) rather than before execution. In database systems, JIT compilation can be used to generate specialized machine code for a given query and data layout. This can lead to significant performance improvements by:

*   **Reducing interpretation overhead:** Directly executing machine code is faster than interpreting a query plan.
*   **Enabling data-centric optimizations:** Code can be specialized based on data types, cardinalities, and value distributions.
*   **Improving instruction cache locality:** Smaller, specialized code can lead to better cache utilization.
*   **Facilitating loop unrolling and vectorization:** Optimizations that are difficult to apply in a generic interpreter.

## HyPer

HyPer is an in-memory database system known for its high performance on analytical workloads (OLAP) and its ability to also handle transactional workloads (OLTP) efficiently (HTAP). Its query processing engine heavily relies on JIT compilation.

**Key Characteristics of HyPer's JIT Compilation:**

*   **Query Compilation:** Entire queries or significant portions of query plans are compiled into machine code.
*   **LLVM-based:** HyPer was one of the pioneering systems to extensively use the LLVM compiler framework for JIT compilation of queries. LLVM provides a rich set of optimization passes and code generation capabilities for various hardware architectures.
*   **Data-centric Code Generation:** The generated code is specialized based on the specific data types of columns involved in the query. For example, if a filter condition is `column_A = 10` and `column_A` is an integer, the compiled code will contain a direct integer comparison, avoiding type checks or conversions at runtime.
*   **Tuple-at-a-time Processing (within compiled code):** While the overall execution model might involve vectorized processing at a higher level, the JIT-compiled code often processes data tuple by tuple, but in a very tight loop that is highly optimized by the compiler. This is sometimes referred to as "push-based" execution within the compiled code.
*   **Operator Fusion:** HyPer's JIT compiler can fuse multiple query operators (e.g., scan, filter, projection) into a single compiled function. This reduces materialization of intermediate results and improves data flow through CPU registers and caches.
*   **Compilation Granularity:** The granularity of compilation is typically at the level of query stages or "pipelines." A query is broken down into pipelines of operators that can be executed together, and each pipeline is JIT-compiled.

**Challenges and Strategies for HyPer (General Considerations):**

*   **Compilation Overhead:** JIT compilation itself takes time. For very short queries, the compilation overhead might outweigh the performance benefits. HyPer likely employs heuristics to decide when to JIT compile a query versus using a traditional interpreter. This might involve thresholds based on query complexity or expected execution time.
*   **Code Cache Management:** Storing compiled code consumes memory. Efficient management of the code cache (e.g., evicting less frequently used compiled queries) is important.
*   **Debugging:** Debugging JIT-compiled code can be more challenging than debugging interpreted code or statically compiled code.
*   **Optimization Trade-offs:** Deciding which LLVM optimization passes to run is a trade-off. More aggressive optimizations can lead to faster code but increase compilation time.

## ClickHouse

ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management system designed for online analytical processing (OLAP). It is known for its extremely fast query execution, which is achieved through a combination of techniques, including vectorized query execution and JIT compilation.

**Key Characteristics of ClickHouse's JIT Compilation:**

*   **Expression Compilation:** ClickHouse primarily JIT-compiles specific expressions within a query rather than the entire query plan as a whole. This is often focused on the "inner loops" of query execution, such as `WHERE` clause predicates and projection calculations.
*   **LLVM-based:** Like HyPer, ClickHouse utilizes LLVM for its JIT compilation capabilities, benefiting from its optimization passes and code generation.
*   **Integration with Vectorized Execution:** ClickHouse's core execution model is vectorized, meaning it processes data in batches (vectors/blocks) rather than tuple by tuple. JIT compilation complements this by generating code that can operate efficiently on these vectors. For example, a compiled expression can be applied to all elements of a vector in a tight loop, potentially with SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) optimizations.
*   **Runtime Code Generation for Specific Operations:** Certain operations or function calls within SQL queries (e.g., complex arithmetic expressions, string manipulations, regular expression matching) can be dynamically compiled into native code to speed up their execution on the given data types.
*   **Focus on CPU-Bound Operations:** JIT compilation is most beneficial for CPU-bound parts of the query. If a query is I/O bound, the gains from JIT compilation might be less significant. ClickHouse's focus is often on optimizing calculations and data manipulation.
*   **Selective Compilation:** ClickHouse might use heuristics to decide whether JIT compilation is worthwhile for a given expression or part of a query. Simple expressions might not benefit enough to justify the compilation overhead.

**Challenges and Strategies for ClickHouse (General Considerations):**

*   **Granularity of Compilation:** The decision of what exactly to compile (individual expressions, parts of a pipeline) is crucial. Compiling too little might not yield significant benefits, while compiling too much can increase overhead.
*   **Overhead vs. Benefit:** Similar to HyPer, there's a trade-off between compilation time and execution speed improvement. This is particularly relevant for a system that aims for very low query latencies. ClickHouse likely has mechanisms to quickly compile simple expressions or fall back to interpretation.
*   **Interaction with Vectorization:** Ensuring that the JIT-compiled code integrates seamlessly and efficiently with the vectorized execution engine is key. The generated code should be optimized for processing data in blocks.

## Peloton

Peloton (now largely succeeded by other projects like HStore/VoltDB in terms of research lineage, and its codebase forked into other systems) was an experimental in-memory database system developed at Carnegie Mellon University. It was designed for high performance, and like HyPer, it incorporated JIT compilation of query plans.

**Key Characteristics of Peloton's JIT Compilation (based on its research goals):**

*   **Whole Query Compilation:** Similar to HyPer, Peloton aimed to compile entire query plans or significant portions of them into native code.
*   **LLVM-based:** Peloton also leveraged LLVM for its JIT compilation, enabling optimizations and code generation for modern CPUs.
*   **Data and Predicate Specialization:** The compiled code would be specialized based on data types and potentially even specific predicate values if known at compile time (though this is a more advanced optimization).
*   **Focus on Reducing Interpretation Overhead:** A primary goal was to eliminate the overhead associated with traditional query plan interpreters, where each operator processes tuples by calling functions on them.
*   **Adaptive Compilation:** Research in the Peloton context explored ideas of adaptive query compilation, where the system might choose to compile or recompile queries based on workload patterns or data characteristics changing over time.
*   **Support for HTAP Workloads:** Peloton was designed to handle both OLTP and OLAP workloads, and its JIT compilation strategy would need to be efficient for both fast, short-running transactions and longer analytical queries. This implies a need for low compilation overhead for OLTP queries.

**Challenges and Strategies for Peloton (General Considerations):**

*   **Compilation Latency for OLTP:** For transactional workloads, query execution times are very short. The overhead of JIT compilation could easily dominate the execution time. Strategies to mitigate this might include:
    *   Caching compiled query plans (parameterized queries).
    *   Using a faster, less optimizing JIT compiler path for simple OLTP queries.
    *   Asynchronous compilation, where a query is first interpreted and then compiled in the background for future executions.
*   **Code Cache Invalidation:** If data schemas change or if adaptive strategies lead to recompilation, managing the compiled code cache and ensuring stale code is invalidated becomes crucial.
*   **Complexity of Implementation:** Integrating a full JIT compiler into a database system is a complex engineering task, requiring expertise in compilers, query processing, and low-level system details.

## Common Patterns, Challenges, and Successful Strategies

Based on the approaches observed in systems like HyPer, ClickHouse, and Peloton (and general JIT compilation principles), several common themes emerge:

**Common Patterns:**

*   **Use of LLVM:** LLVM is a dominant compiler framework used for JIT compilation in high-performance database systems. Its modularity, rich optimization passes, and support for multiple architectures make it a strong choice.
*   **Data-Centric Code Generation:** Specializing code based on actual data types (and sometimes data values or statistics) is a core pattern. This eliminates type checking, boxing/unboxing, and allows for more direct data manipulation.
*   **Operator Fusion/Pipeline Compilation:** Compiling sequences of query operators (pipelines) together into a single function is common. This reduces function call overhead and minimizes materialization of intermediate results, improving cache performance.
*   **Focus on CPU-Intensive Parts:** JIT compilation efforts are often concentrated on the most CPU-intensive parts of query execution, such as predicate evaluation, expression calculation, and aggregation logic.

**Common Challenges:**

*   **Compilation Overhead:** The time spent compiling code is a critical overhead. This is especially problematic for short-running queries (common in OLTP) or ad-hoc analytical queries.
    *   **Successful Strategies:**
        *   **Selective Compilation:** Using heuristics (based on query complexity, cost estimates, or execution frequency) to decide whether to JIT compile or interpret.
        *   **Tiered Compilation:** Employing multiple compilation strategies (e.g., a quick, basic compilation vs. a slower, more optimizing compilation) or starting with interpretation and then asynchronously compiling hot queries.
        *   **Caching Compiled Code:** Storing and reusing compiled code for parameterized queries or frequently executed query patterns.
*   **Code Cache Management:** The compiled code consumes memory. Efficiently managing this cache, including eviction policies for stale or less-used code, is necessary.
*   **Debugging and Complexity:** Developing, debugging, and maintaining a JIT compilation engine adds significant complexity to the database system.
    *   **Successful Strategies:** Leveraging mature frameworks like LLVM can help, but expertise in compiler internals is still often required. Robust testing and diagnostic tools are essential.
*   **Granularity of Compilation:** Deciding whether to compile entire queries, individual expressions, or something in between is a design challenge with performance implications.
    *   **Successful Strategies:** This often depends on the system's architecture. Systems like HyPer and Peloton lean towards whole-query or large-pipeline compilation for OLAP, while ClickHouse demonstrates success with finer-grained expression compilation within its vectorized model.
*   **Portability:** While LLVM helps, ensuring optimal code generation across different hardware architectures can still be challenging.

**Successful Strategies (General):**

*   **Integration with Execution Model:** JIT compilation should be tightly integrated with the overall query execution model (e.g., vectorized execution in ClickHouse, push-based tuple processing in compiled HyPer pipelines).
*   **Balancing Optimization Levels:** Choosing the right set of compiler optimization passes is important. Too few may not yield enough performance, while too many can increase compilation time excessively.
*   **Adaptive Approaches:** Systems that can adapt their compilation strategy based on the workload, data characteristics, or observed performance are likely to be more robust. This can include recompiling queries if data distributions change significantly.
*   **Fallback to Interpretation:** Having a robust interpreter as a fallback for queries that are not JIT-compiled (or for which compilation fails) is crucial for system stability.

## Conclusion

JIT compilation has proven to be a powerful technique for achieving high query performance in modern database systems. By generating specialized machine code at runtime, databases can significantly reduce interpretation overhead, exploit data-specific knowledge, and leverage modern CPU capabilities more effectively. While challenges related to compilation overhead, complexity, and code management exist, the ongoing research and successful implementations in systems like HyPer and ClickHouse demonstrate the significant benefits of this approach, particularly for analytical workloads.
