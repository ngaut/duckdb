# JIT Compilation Framework Evaluation for DuckDB

## Introduction

This document evaluates potential Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation frameworks for DuckDB, a high-performance analytical database system. The goal of JIT compilation in DuckDB would be to further optimize query execution, especially for CPU-bound analytical queries, by generating specialized machine code at runtime. We consider three main options: LLVM, asmjit, and a custom JIT framework. The evaluation is based on general knowledge of these frameworks and DuckDB's architecture.

## Evaluation Criteria

The frameworks will be compared based on the following criteria:

*   **Performance:** Potential runtime performance of JIT-compiled code and compilation speed.
*   **Complexity:** Complexity of integration, development effort, and maintenance.
*   **Suitability for DuckDB:** How well the framework aligns with DuckDB's architecture (vectorized execution, C++ codebase, portability needs, desire for low overhead).
*   **Features:** Richness of the feature set (e.g., optimization capabilities, target architecture support, debugging tools).
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** Size and activity of the community, availability of documentation, and third-party tools.
*   **Licensing:** Compatibility with DuckDB's MIT license.

## Frameworks

### 1. LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)

**Description:** LLVM is a comprehensive compiler infrastructure, offering a modular set of libraries for building compilers, JIT engines, and other language tools. It provides a sophisticated intermediate representation (IR), extensive optimization passes, and backends for many CPU architectures.

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Runtime Performance:** Excellent. LLVM is capable of generating highly optimized machine code, often on par with optimizing C++ compilers like GCC or Clang. Its vast suite of optimization passes can significantly speed up complex computations.
    *   **Compilation Speed:** Can be slow, especially if many optimization passes are enabled. This is a major concern for query JIT compilation where compilation overhead needs to be low.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Integration:** High. LLVM is a large and complex framework. Integrating it into a project requires significant effort and expertise. The API is extensive.
    *   **Development Effort:** High. Generating LLVM IR and managing compilation pipelines requires a steep learning curve.
    *   **Maintenance:** High, due to the size of the dependency and the need to keep up with LLVM API changes.

*   **Suitability for DuckDB:**
    *   **Vectorized Execution:** LLVM can generate code suitable for vectorized execution, including SIMD instructions.
    *   **C++ Codebase:** LLVM itself is written in C++ and integrates well with C++ projects.
    *   **Portability:** Excellent cross-platform support.
    *   **Overhead:** High compilation overhead and potentially large library dependency size are significant drawbacks for DuckDB, which aims to be lightweight and fast to initialize.

*   **Features:**
    *   **Optimization Capabilities:** Extremely rich.
    *   **Target Architecture Support:** Very broad.
    *   **Debugging Tools:** Good support for debugging generated code.

*   **Community and Ecosystem:**
    *   Very large, active community. Extensive documentation and resources.

*   **Licensing:**
    *   Apache 2.0 License with LLVM exceptions, which is generally compatible with MIT.

### 2. asmjit

**Description:** asmjit is a lightweight C++ library for runtime code generation. It allows developers to emit machine code directly (x86, x64, ARM, AArch64) using a C++ API that can be at a lower level (direct assembly) or a higher-level "compiler" interface that handles register allocation and instruction scheduling.

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Runtime Performance:** Very good. While it doesn't have the extensive high-level optimization passes of LLVM, it allows for fine-grained control, and its higher-level compiler can produce efficient code. For targeted optimizations of specific code patterns (common in database expressions), it can be highly effective.
    *   **Compilation Speed:** Excellent. asmjit is designed for fast code generation.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Integration:** Low to Medium. It's a header-only library or can be compiled as a static/shared library, making it relatively easy to integrate.
    *   **Development Effort:** Medium. Understanding assembly concepts is beneficial, but its "Compiler" API abstracts much of this. Simpler than LLVM IR generation.
    *   **Maintenance:** Low. Smaller, more focused API.

*   **Suitability for DuckDB:**
    *   **Vectorized Execution:** Can be used to generate specialized loops and functions that operate on vectors of data, including SIMD.
    *   **C++ Codebase:** Native C++ library.
    *   **Portability:** Good support for major architectures (x86/x64, ARM/AArch64). DuckDB's primary targets are well covered.
    *   **Overhead:** Very low compilation overhead and small library footprint. This aligns well with DuckDB's goals.

*   **Features:**
    *   **Optimization Capabilities:** Basic instruction scheduling, register allocation. Not as extensive as LLVM, but sufficient for many JIT tasks in databases (e.g., inlining small functions, constant folding at runtime, specializing loops).
    *   **Target Architecture Support:** Good for DuckDB's needs.
    *   **Debugging Tools:** Debugging generated assembly can be challenging, but tools like `gdb` can be used. Less high-level debugging support than LLVM.

*   **Community and Ecosystem:**
    *   Smaller than LLVM, but active and responsive. Good documentation and examples.

*   **Licensing:**
    *   Zlib license, which is permissive and compatible with MIT.

### 3. Custom JIT Framework

**Description:** This would involve building a JIT compiler from scratch or by significantly extending a very minimal code generation library. The custom JIT would be tailored specifically to DuckDB's internal structures and query execution patterns.

*   **Performance:**
    *   **Runtime Performance:** Potentially very good if highly specialized for DuckDB's specific needs. However, achieving the level of optimization of a mature framework is a massive undertaking.
    *   **Compilation Speed:** Could be designed to be extremely fast by focusing only on necessary features.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Integration:** N/A (built in-house).
    *   **Development Effort:** Extremely High. Building a robust and correct JIT compiler, even a simple one, is a very complex task involving deep knowledge of compiler design and target architectures.
    *   **Maintenance:** Extremely High. This would become a significant ongoing burden for the DuckDB team.

*   **Suitability for DuckDB:**
    *   **Vectorized Execution:** Could be perfectly tailored.
    *   **C++ Codebase:** N/A.
    *   **Portability:** Would need to be implemented for each target architecture, a major effort.
    *   **Overhead:** Could be designed for minimal overhead.

*   **Features:**
    *   **Optimization Capabilities:** Initially very limited, unless significant effort is invested.
    *   **Target Architecture Support:** Would have to be built incrementally.
    *   **Debugging Tools:** Would need to be developed from scratch.

*   **Community and Ecosystem:**
    *   None (internal project).

*   **Licensing:**
    *   N/A (internal project, would be MIT).

**Preliminary Recommendation:**

Based on this initial evaluation, **asmjit** appears to be a very promising candidate for DuckDB.
*   It offers a good balance of performance and low compilation overhead.
*   Its C++ nature and easier integration path are well-suited for DuckDB.
*   The licensing is compatible.
*   It can effectively support vectorized execution and generate specialized code for expressions and tight loops, which are common optimization targets in analytical databases.

LLVM, while powerful, likely introduces too much complexity and compilation overhead for DuckDB's typical use cases and design philosophy (fast, lightweight, embedded). The development and maintenance burden of a fully custom JIT framework is likely prohibitive.

Further investigation would involve creating small prototypes or benchmarks with asmjit to confirm its performance characteristics and ease of use for typical DuckDB JIT compilation tasks (e.g., compiling simple arithmetic expressions or filter predicates).
